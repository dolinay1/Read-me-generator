# Description
This readme was created using the Readme Generator application. The user is asked a series of questions on what information they would like to add to the Readme. The application then creates a formatted Readme for the user based on the information the user entered for each category. A table of contents is added to allow easier navigation of the Readme. At the bottom of the Readme a contact section is added which includes the users email, badges relating to the user's Github profile and current repo's commit history, and a profile picture. The application was created entirely using Node JS. One small bug with the commit history badge is that it may say invalid even though it functions properly.
